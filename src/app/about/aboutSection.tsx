        I’m a highly motivated, adaptable person with strong organizational and
        interpersonal skills. I’m comfortable taking ownership, solving
        problems, and working closely with people in fast-moving, real-world
        environments.
        <br />
        <br />
        My background spans technical, operational, and hands-on roles, often
        requiring a balance of planning, communication, and execution. I’ve
        consistently worked in positions where reliability, collaboration, and
        sound judgment matter just as much as technical ability.
        <br />
        <br />
        Outside of work, I’m driven by long-standing interests in sport, music,
        and creative projects, which continue to shape how I approach teamwork,
        systems, and problem-solving in both professional and personal settings.
