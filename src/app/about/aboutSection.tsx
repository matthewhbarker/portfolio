        Hello! I&apos;m Matthew Barker, a Computer Science graduate with a
        lifelong fascination for technology. From an early age, I found myself
        captivated by how things work, especially when it came to computers.
        This curiosity has been a driving force in my journey through roles in
        data processing, software development, and team management. Along the
        way, I&apos;ve developed strong technical skills in languages and
        frameworks like Python, SQL, Next.js, and React. Beyond technical
        expertise, my people-focused approach has shaped my career. I thrive in
        roles that allow me to bridge the gap between technology and human
        needsâ€”whether it&apos;s working with clients as a freelance developer or
        managing team operations at Byte Camp. I enjoy guiding projects and
        people, creating environments where collaboration can flourish, and
        ensuring smooth processes across the board. I&apos;ve always pursued
        projects and hobbies that let me explore technology in meaningful ways.
        As a side hustle, I&apos;ve taken on web development projects, and in my
        free time, I enjoy building games and producing electronic music. My
        goal is to continue growing as a versatile professional who combines
        technical skill with strong interpersonal abilities, bringing a balanced
        approach to every project I work on.
